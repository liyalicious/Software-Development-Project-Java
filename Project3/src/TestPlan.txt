So for testing the addPlayList() method, there were really three things we were concerned about:
1) The playlist was successfully added
		We tested this by adding a playlist1 to a playlist2, and then checking to make sure that the first item in playlist2 
		is in fact playlist 1
2) The addPlayList() method returns true when a playlist is successfully added.
		We tested for this pretty much the same way as we did 1), except we tested to make sure that it returned true when done
3) Duplicates aren't allowed to be added to a playlist
		We tested this by adding a playlist to a playlist, and then trying to add the same playlist again, which returns false

For the addPlayable() method, there was even less that we had to check. We were mainly concerned with two things:
1) The Playable was successfully added
		We tested for this the same we did for addPlayList()
2) The addPlayable() method returns true when a Playable is successfully added
		We tested for this the same way we did for addPlayList()
		
There were a lot more things that had to be taken into consideration for loadMedia():
1) It adds a simple song with no complications
2) It adds a song with comments 
3) It correctly calculates the number of minutes when a song's duration is displayed incorrectly
4) It correctly calculates the number of seconds when a song's duration is displayed incorrectly
5) If a text file has spaces, it is able to look past the spaces and correctly add the song
6) If a text file has both spaces and comments, it is able to correctly add the song
7) It is able to distinguish between a song and a video based on the input, and add them as such to the playlist
8) It adds a simple song with no complications
9) It adds a video with comments
10) It adds a video with "trickier" comments, such as lines with only comments
11) It correctly reads and adds "http://" to the youtube address
12) It deals correctly with varying capitalization of youtube
